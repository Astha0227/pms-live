# pms-live (Project Management System)
This is a simple project management system using the Django framework and Postgres as the backend. This application is working seamlessly on the local host.

This is not live yet because I have tried to deploy it to the Heroku server but it is not supporting python 3.10 yet. I am trying to solve this problem.

The application will live as soon as I find the solution. Thank you for showing your interest.
