# pms-live (Project Management System)
This is a simple project management system using the Django framework and Postgres as the database. This application is working seamlessly on the local host.

This is not live yet because I have tried to deploy it to the Heroku server but it is not supporting python 3.10 yet. I am trying to solve this problem.

The application will be live as soon as I find the solution.

I have already uploaded the demonstration video link of the project management system in the description of the project. Please check it out.

This application is used for assigning tasks, sending notes, and assigning priorities of work to developers. For keeping a track record of project development. 

This application is developed by using insights from the youtube channel Dennis Ivys.

Thank you for showing your interest.
